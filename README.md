TITLE:

Predicting Loan Repayment Ability with Grade Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

AIM:

The principle focus of our project is to perform data analysis and train a model using the most popular Machine Learning algorithm – Regularized Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Neural Networks in order to analyse the historical data that is present regarding the Loan Repayment.

ABSTRACT:

Evaluating and predicting the repayment ability of the loaners is important for the banks to minimize the risk of loan payment default. By this reason, there is a system created by the banks to process the loan request based on the loaners’ status, such as employment status, credit history, etc.. However, the current existing evaluation system might not be appropriate to evaluate some loaners repayment ability, such as students or people without credit histories. In order to properly assess the repayment ability of all groups of people, we trained various machine learning models on a Lending club dataset and evaluated the importance of all the features used. Then, based on the importance score of the features, we analyze and select the most identifiable features to predict the repayment ability of the loaner.

INTRODUCTION:

Due to insufficient credit histories, many people are struggling to get loans from trustworthy sources, such as banks. These people are normally students or unemployed adults, who might not have enough knowledge to justify the credibility of the unidentified lenders. The untrustworthy lenders can take advantage of these borrowers by taking high interest rates or including hidden terms in the contract. Instead of evaluating the borrower based on their credit score, there are many other alternative ways to measure or predict their repayment abilities. For example, employment can be a big factor to affect the person’s repayment ability since an employed adult has more stable incomes and cash flow. Some other factors, such as real estates, marriage status and the city of residence, might also be useful in the study of the repayment ability. Therefore, in our project, we are planning to use machine learning algorithms to study the correlations between borrower status and their repayment ability. We found the dataset from Lending club, to be used in this project. This open dataset contains 100K anonymous client’s with 152 unique features. By studying the correlation between these features and repayment ability of the clients, our algorithm can help lenders evaluate borrowers from more dimensions and can also help borrowers, especially those who do not have sufficient credit histories, to find credible loaner, leading to a win-win situation.
